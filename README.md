Bits
====
When I use the c++'s STL, I find the bitset must hava a const, for example, you can define:<br/>
bitset<3>;<br/>
but you can't write:<br/>
it n = 3; bitset<n><br/>
So I write it myself, in my code, I store the bit in an array, if you want to visit the first bit, you can write:<br/>
//you have a bit object bits<br/>
std::cout<<bits[1];<br/>
of course, the object can be used as left-value or right-value<br/>
if you use it as left-value, for example<br/>
int n;<br/>
bits[3] = n;<br/>
if n is 0, bits[3]==0, otherwise, bits[3]==1<br/>
